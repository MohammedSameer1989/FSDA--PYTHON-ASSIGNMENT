    "Answer -In an Excel spreadsheet, \"cells\" refer to the individual rectangular boxes where you can input, edit, and display data. Each cell is identified by a unique combination of a letter and a number, which indicates its column and row position. For example, the cell at the intersection of column B and row 3 would be referred to as \"B3\". Cells can contain various types of data, such as numbers, text, dates, formulas, and functions, and they are the fundamental building blocks of any Excel worksheet."

If you want to open a completely separate instance of Excel (i.e., a new Excel window), you can usually do so by clicking on the Excel icon in your taskbar (Windows) or by using your operating system's application launcher (Windows or macOS)."

    "Answer- In Excel, relative cell references are used when you want a formula to adjust automatically when copied or filled across cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where you would typically use relative cell references:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing Calculations: If you have a formula that calculates values based on the contents of other cells, using relative cell references allows you to apply the same calculation to different cells within the worksheet. For example, if you have a formula in cell C2 that adds the values in cells A2 and B2 (=A2+B2), you can copy this formula to cell C3, and it will automatically adjust to add the values in cells A3 and B3 (=A3+B3).\n",
    "Data Analysis: When analyzing data in a table or database, relative cell references allow you to perform consistent calculations or comparisons across different rows or columns. For instance, if you're calculating the percentage change between two consecutive months in a sales report, relative references ensure that the formula adjusts correctly for each row of data.\n",
    "Copying Formulas: When you need to replicate a formula pattern across multiple cells, relative references ensure that the formula adapts to the relative positions of the cells involved. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or when creating complex formulas that need to be applied to different parts of the worksheet.\n",
    "Dynamic Ranges: Relative references are often used to create dynamic ranges in formulas, allowing formulas to automatically adjust as new data is added to the worksheet. For example, if you're summing a range of values, using relative references in the formula ensures that the sum updates automatically as new rows or columns are added to the dataset.\n",
    "Overall, relative cell references are essential for creating flexible and scalable Excel formulas that can be easily applied and adapted to different parts of your worksheet or workbook."
